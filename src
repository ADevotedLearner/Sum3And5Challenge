/*

//SUM 3 AND 5 CHALLENGE//

Create a 'for' loop using a range of number from 1 to 1000 inclusive.

Sum all the numbers that can be divided by both 3 and 5.

Print out the numbers that have met the conditions above.

Break out the loop once. You have found 5 numbers that have met the conditions above.

After breaking out of the loop, print the sum of the numbers that met the conditions above.
